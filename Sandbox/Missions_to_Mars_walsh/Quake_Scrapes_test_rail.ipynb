      "  AP April 17, 2016UPDATED: April 17, 2016 19:31 IST  Residents look for survivors in the rubble of a destroyed house sleep in the Pacific coastal town of Pedernales. Photo: APAuthorities in Ecuador are mobilizing resources and help is getting to the ground after a long night of fear and uncertainty caused by a magnitude-7.8 earthquake that killed at least 77 people.Vice President Jorge Glas is overseeing efforts until President Rafael Correa makes an emergency return from a visit to Rome. Glas arrived Sunday morning in Manta along the coast along with dozens of rescuers. The city's airport is badly damaged, but is receiving relief flights.National airline TAME has already organized two humanitarian airlifts with members of the Red Cross and police reinforcements.More than a dozen roads have been closed due to damage from the earthquake, making it harder for rescuers to reach where they are needed most.The Transportation Ministry says that the hardest hit was Manabi province, near the epicenter. Eight major roads there were either closed or partially collapsed from landslides or strong movements of the earth.  Ecuador's seismological institute is reporting more than 135 aftershocks following Saturday's magnitude-7.8 quake that ravaged the country's coastline.The strongest occurred overnight around 2 a.m. local time about 50 miles (80 kilometers) from the main quake's epicenter and was felt in cities hundreds of miles kilometers away.The U.S. Geological Survey said that quake had a magnitude of 5.6.Authorities are warning that more aftershocks are in store in the coming hours and days. Also Read: Powerful earthquake kills 77 in Ecuador, tsunami warning lifted.text-app-download{overflow: hidden;} .text-app-download a{color:#fff;font-weight: bold;}Get real-time alerts and all the news on your phone with the all-new India Today app. Download from\n"
